# Simple TCP Chat Application
A lightweight TCP-based Client-Server Chat Application built with C# to demonstrate real-time communication using sockets. This project is designed for educational purposes to showcase how TCP sockets work in operating systems.


## Features
- Real-time message exchange between a client and a server.
- Uses TCP protocol for reliable, direct communication.
- Easy-to-read and understand code structure.
- Error handling for connection and message transmission issues.


## How It Works
1. **Server:** Listens for incoming client connections on a specific port (default: `5000`).
2. **Client:** Connects to the server using its IP address and sends messages.
3. Messages are exchanged in real-time and displayed on the respective consoles.


## Project Structure
1. **Server:** The application that listens for connections and handles incoming data from the client.
2. **Client:** The application that connects to the server and sends messages.


## Built With
- C#
- .NET Framework
- SimpleTCP Library


## Acknowledgments
This project was created to explain sockets and TCP communication in operating systems. It is intended to be simple and educational, ideal for students and beginners in network programming.
